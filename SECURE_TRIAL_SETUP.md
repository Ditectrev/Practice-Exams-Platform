# Secure Trial System Setup Guide

## üö® Security Issue Fixed

The previous trial system was **easily bypassed** because:

- ‚ùå Trial data stored in localStorage (easily cleared)
- ‚ùå No server-side validation
- ‚ùå Users could refresh page to restart trial
- ‚ùå Incognito mode = unlimited trials
- ‚ùå Multiple devices = unlimited access

## üîí New Secure System

The new system tracks trials **server-side** using:

- ‚úÖ **Session ID tracking** - Persistent session-based identification
- ‚úÖ **Device fingerprinting** - Additional security layer
- ‚úÖ **Appwrite database** - Server-side validation
- ‚úÖ **Automatic expiration** - Trials expire after 15 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Persistent tracking** - Cannot be bypassed by clearing storage
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate prevention** - Handles React Strict Mode gracefully

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Appwrite Database

1. **Go to your Appwrite Console**
2. **Create a new database**:

   - Database ID: `abc_123`
   - Name: `ABC 123`
   - Description: `Database for tracking user trials`

3. **Create a collection**:

   - Collection ID: `trials`
   - Name: `Trial Records`
   - Add these attributes:

     ```text
     session_id (string, 255 chars, required)
     user_agent (string, 1000 chars, required)
     start_time (integer, required)
     end_time (integer, required)
     is_active (boolean, required)
     device_fingerprint (string, 1000 chars, required)
     ```

4. **Create indexes** for efficient queries:

   ```text
   Index 1: session_id (key)
   Index 2: device_fingerprint (key)
   Index 3: is_active, end_time (composite key)
   ```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Your existing Appwrite config
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=your_collection_id
```

### Step 3: Run Setup Script (Optional)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install appwrite node-appwrite

# Run the setup script
node scripts/setup-trial-database.js
```

### Step 4: Update Your Code

The code has been updated to use `useSecureTrial` instead of `useTrialTimer`. The new hook provides:

- `isLoading` - Shows loading state while checking trial status
- `trialExpired` - Trial has expired
- `trialBlocked` - Trial access is blocked (session already used)
- `isAccessBlocked` - Combined state for blocking access
- `isInTrial` - User is currently in active trial
- `timeRemaining` - Time left in trial
- `formatTimeRemaining()` - Formatted time display

## üîß How It Works

### Trial Creation

1. **User visits site** ‚Üí Check if session/device already has trial
2. **No existing trial** ‚Üí Create new trial record in database
3. **Existing active trial** ‚Üí Resume from saved time
4. **Existing expired trial** ‚Üí Block access (trial already used)

### Trial Tracking

- **Session ID**: Primary identifier (persistent across page refreshes)
- **Device Fingerprint**: Canvas + screen + timezone + language
- **User Agent**: Browser information
- **Timestamps**: Start and end times
- **Active Status**: Whether trial is currently active

### Trial Expiration

- **Automatic**: Trials expire after exactly 15 minutes
- **Database Update**: `is_active` set to false
- **Access Blocked**: User redirected to home page

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Session-Based Limitation

- One trial per session ID (persistent across page refreshes)
- Cannot be bypassed by clearing browser data
- Works across all browsers on same device

### Device Fingerprinting

- Canvas fingerprinting
- Screen resolution and color depth
- Timezone and language
- Additional security layer

### Server-Side Validation

- All trial logic runs on server
- Client cannot manipulate trial status
- Database persistence across sessions

### Automatic Cleanup

- Expired trials marked as inactive
- Old trial records can be cleaned up periodically
- Efficient database queries with indexes

### Duplicate Prevention

- Handles React Strict Mode gracefully
- Prevents multiple trial creation
- Race condition protection

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Normal Trial Flow**:

   - Visit site ‚Üí Trial starts
   - Use for 15 minutes ‚Üí Trial expires
   - Try to access ‚Üí Blocked

2. **Session Limitation**:

   - Use trial on one device
   - Try different browser on same device ‚Üí Blocked

3. **Page Refresh**:

   - Start trial ‚Üí Refresh page ‚Üí Trial continues (not reset)

4. **Browser Data Clear**:

   - Start trial ‚Üí Clear localStorage ‚Üí Trial continues (not reset)

5. **Incognito Mode**:

   - Use trial in normal browser
   - Try incognito mode on same device ‚Üí Blocked

6. **IP Change Scenarios**:

   - Same browser, same IP ‚Üí Trial continues
   - Same browser, IP change ‚Üí Trial continues (session ID)
   - Different browser, same IP ‚Üí Blocked (device fingerprint)
   - Incognito, same IP ‚Üí Blocked (device fingerprint)
   - Incognito, different IP ‚Üí Fresh trial (new user)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Matrix

| Scenario                   | Result         | Reason                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Same browser, same IP      | ‚úÖ Continues   | Session ID match           |
| Same browser, IP change    | ‚úÖ Continues   | Session ID match           |
| Different browser, same IP | ‚ùå Blocked     | Device fingerprint match   |
| Incognito, same IP         | ‚ùå Blocked     | Device fingerprint match   |
| Incognito, different IP    | ‚úÖ Fresh trial | New user (incognito + VPN) |
| Page refresh               | ‚úÖ Continues   | Session ID persistence     |
| Clear localStorage         | ‚úÖ Continues   | Server-side validation     |
| VPN switch (same browser)  | ‚úÖ Continues   | Session ID persistence     |

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
-- Trial Records Table
CREATE TABLE trials (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  user_agent VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
  start_time BIGINT NOT NULL,
  end_time BIGINT NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  device_fingerprint VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_session_id ON trials(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_device_fingerprint ON trials(device_fingerprint);
CREATE INDEX idx_active_trials ON trials(is_active, end_time);
```

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

The new system is **backward compatible**:

- Old `useTrialTimer` still works
- New `useSecureTrial` provides enhanced security
- Components automatically use new secure system
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tools

The system includes comprehensive debugging scripts in the `scripts/` folder:

- **`debug-trials.js`** - View current trials and their status
- **`cleanup-trials.js`** - Remove expired or duplicate trials
- **`test-trial-system.js`** - Verify all functionality works
- **`monitor-trials.js`** - Watch trials in real-time
- **`setup-trial-database.js`** - Set up the database and collection

See `scripts/README.md` for detailed usage instructions.

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### Performance

- Database queries are indexed for speed
- Session ID generation is lightweight
- Minimal client-server communication

### Scalability

- Database can handle high traffic
- Indexes ensure fast queries
- Automatic cleanup of old records

### Privacy

- Session IDs are generated locally
- Device fingerprints are anonymized
- No personal data collected

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Database not found"**:

   - Run the setup script
   - Check database ID matches

2. **"Collection not found"**:

   - Create the collection manually
   - Verify all attributes are added

3. **"Permission denied"**:

   - Check Appwrite API key
   - Verify database permissions

4. **"Trial not starting"**:

   - Check network connection
   - Verify session ID generation is working

5. **"Duplicate trials created"**:

   - This is normal in development (React Strict Mode)
   - Use `cleanup-trials.js --duplicates-only` to clean up
   - Production builds don't have this issue

### Debug Mode

Add to your component for debugging:

```tsx
const { trialExpired, trialBlocked, isLoading } = useSecureTrial();
console.log("Trial Status:", { trialExpired, trialBlocked, isLoading });
```
